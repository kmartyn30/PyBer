***PyBer Analysis*** 


*Purpose of the New Analysis:

  Omar was presented a new assiggnment from V. Isualized to code in Python with Pandas to create a summary DataFrame. The purpose of Pyber Analysis was to  indicate how the data compares and contrasts by city type and the disparity in the data can utilied by decision-makers within at Pyber. 

*Results: 

  Omar reviewed the data results from the summary DateFrame to detemine the differences in ride-sharing data amoung the various cities from the three regions, Urban, Suburban and Rural cities. As you can view in the below tables the break down from the Urban to Suburban fare is extensively moderate in the sample provided compared to that of the Rural cities. In the rural area the sample provided rural fare was extensively higher in certain cities such as Michealberg with the fare of $54.85 and Lake Latoyabury $51.81. Whereas in the Urban communities the sample indicated South Jack shows $34.58 and Port Samanthamouth record fare was $33.44. Overall a disparity in their fares were siggnificant according to the sample of the top five cities in Urban, Suburban and Rural citites.

 Another comparison that Omar reflected on was the driver count within the three regions demonstrated in the tables. The leading city  driver count for the Urban area cities were in the lead South Miichelleport with a driver count of 72, then a dip to 57 driver count by Port Samanthamouth. Trailing behind in third place was South Jacks with a 46 driver count, to follow Rodnetfourt 34 and Lake Jonathanshire driver count 5. One indicator to the success was the fare was moderately priced.

 An additional note, the rural cities divier cout was exptremely low indicated form the top four sample cities Randellchester diver count was 9, North Holly was 8, Michaelberg was 6, Lake Latoyabury was 4 diver count. Omar speculated that the low drive count was due to the respective cost involved in the rural cities.

Finally, the driver count in Suburban cities were comparibly above the rural diver count.Lake Omar reflected  22 driver count, East Kenstad 20, Myersshire 19, Barronchester wrapped up driver count with 11. They were moderately priced however were not as successful as that of the Urban cities.


**Total Rides for Each City Type:
  Omar reviewed the total rided in each of the three cities types. The Urban cities of Carriemouth and Christopherfurt, both were tied with 27 total rides. The read were moderate lowerest in the tip five sample of 22, for Barajasview, Deanville 19 rides and Amandaburgh 18 total rides. 

                                      Urban City Total Rides:

As you can view that Suburban cities total rides were making gradual progress in the total ride count. The highest cities were Colemanland with 22 rides and Brandonfort 19 rides

Lastly the Rural cities were lowerer with ride count. Bradshwafurt rides were 10 and a three way ties with 6 rides were Harringtonfort, Jessicaport, Lake Jamie and finally Garzaport with 3 rides.

Average Fare for City Type:

The average city fare per city type indicated that the suburan, rural and urban cities average fare was comprable in fare in the sample for the top five cities in each of the areas as you can view in the tables below.

***Average Number Drivers in Each Cities:


As you can interpert in the tables provided Omar was able to compare the average number of drivers to each of the type of cities. He determined that the driver count average was higher in the Urban cities for example Deanville average number of drive was 49, and Christopherfurt was close with 41.0 average divers. The suburban cities exhibited a moderate average driver count for Colemanland and Davidfurt with a similar average drive count of 23.0 and  Bethanyland 22.0 respectively.

***Average Fare Per Day for Urban, Suburban, Rural Cities:

As Omar impressed during his new anlysis overview the rural cites were extensively higheer in price especial diring the month of January 2019.

Business recommendations:
Is is suggested for the three disparies among the Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities based on the overview in analysis in order to keep cost down and the drivers and rides condusive to a higher overhead they would require to review their weekly fare in the rural cities due to the lower rides but highest fare. 
In the Urban cities it would be recommented due to being the leading city driver count for the Urban area cities were in the lead South Miichelleport with a driver count of 72, then a dip to 57 driver count by Port Samanthamouth. One indicator to the success was the fare was moderately priced so it should continue the momentum and review any cities that may require an overview to increase rides, drives with a moderate cost in mind. 

The Suburban cities with the lower driver and ride count should review their operational service of maketing in those two areas with the mindset that if they increase the price they possible would have lower fares similarly to that of the rural cities.
