***PyBer Analysis*** 
*Purpose of the New Analysis:
Omar was presented a new assiggnment from V. Isualized to code in Python with Pandas to create a summary DataFrame. The purpose of Pyber Analysis was to  indicate how the data compares and contrasts by city type and the disparity in the data can utilied by decision-makers within at Pyber. 
*Results: 
 Omar reviewed the data results from the summary DateFrame to detemine the differences in ride-sharing data amoung the various cities from the three regions, Urban, Suburban and Rural cities.  As you can view in the below tables the break down from the Urban to Suburban fare is extensively moderate in the sample provided compared to that of the Rural cities. In the rural area the sample provided rural fare was extensively higher in certain cities such as Michealberg with the fare of $54.85 and Lake Latoyabury $51.81. Whereas in the Urban communities the sample indicated South Jack shows $34.58 and Port Samanthamouth record fare was $33.44. Overall a disparity in their fares were siggnificant according to the sample of the top five cities in Urban, Suburban and Rural citites.

 Another comparison that Omar reflected on was the driver count within the three regions demonstrated in the tables. The leading city  driver count for the Urban area cities were in the lead South Miichelleport with a driver count of 72, then a dip to 57 driver count by Port Samanthamouth. Trailing behind in third place was South Jacks with a 46 driver count, to follow Rodnetfourt 34 and Lake Jonathanshire driver count 5. One indicator to the success was the fare was moderately priced. 
 
 Suburban Cities

 An additional note, the rural cities divier cout was exptremely low indicated form the top five sample cities Randellchester diver count was 9, North Holly was 8, Michaelberg was 6, Lake Latoyabury was 4 diver count. Omar speculated that the low drive count was due to the respective cost involved in the rural cities. 
 
 Rural Cities

Finally, the driver count in Suburban cities were comparibly above the rural diver count.Lake Omar reflected  22 driver count, East Kenstad 20, Myersshire 19, Barronchester wrapped up driver count with 11. They were moderately priced however were not as successful as that of the Urban cities.
